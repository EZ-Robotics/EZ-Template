**EZ-Template is a simple plug-and-play PROS template that handles drive base functions, autonomous selector, input curves, and active brake with PTO support.**

## Features
- Simple to setup 
- PID for driving, turning, swing turns, and arcs
- Easy to use PID tuner 
- Speed ramp-up for driving
- Asynchronous PID with blocking functions until settled and until a specific position has come
- Joystick input curves
- Live adjustment of input curves 
- Basic autonomous selector
- SD card saving of autonomous selector and joystick curves
- "Tug of war" detection for autonomous
- PID exit conditions for when drive motors overheat 
- Tank drive, single stick arcade, and dual stick arcade
- Loading animation during IMU calibration
- 3 wire encoder and rotation sensor support
- Add / remove motors from the drive dynamically to allow for PTO use
- Exposed PID class for use with your other subsystems
- Exposed slew class for gradual speed ramp-up for your other subsystems
